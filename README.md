# quantum-world

This repository contains the experiment data for the article:

M. Mannone, V. Seidita, and A. Chella, “Categories, Quantum Computing, and Swarm Robotics: A Case Study,” Mathematics, in press, 2022

In particular, it contains:

- the code used in the article (code.qasm);
- the screenshots of a few code executions on quantum simulators and quantum computers (folder ‘screenshots’);
- this README file.

The code is given here as a .qasm file. To be compiled, its content should be copy-pasted into IBM Quantum Composer (https://quantum-computing.ibm.com/composer/) and be run online. Alternatively, the file code.qasm can be called from Quantum Composer.

Options for running the code include quantum simulators and quantum computers, remotely accessed through IBM Quantum portal. 

The screenshots of the performed executions of the code have been included in the folder ‘screenshots.’ Replications of the experiment will lead to slightly different outcomes because of quantum fluctuations in each shot of the code. We used quantum simulators and the real quantum computer of Bogotà, Colombia.

Details about the meaning and significance of the experiment are provided in the article.
